#      step earlier in the workflow that extracts the actual CN from the
#      just-imported keychain and writes it into `$GITHUB_ENV`; local
#      developers can also export it manually).
#   2. Auto-detection from `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`,
#      preferring `Developer ID Application` (suitable for distribution).
#      This works for forks/multi-developer setups without editing this
#      file — the previous hardcoded "Developer ID Application: <Name>
#      (<TeamID>)" default broke any fork whose Apple cert had a different
#      CN with `codesign: no identity found`.
#   3. Empty (no identity found) — codesign will then fail downstream
#      with a clear error.
