# Weather skill (visual widget reference)

This is the v5 reference ``type: extension`` skill shipped with NEILA.
It demonstrates the minimum viable widget extension:

- A manifest declaring ``type: extension`` + an ``ui_tab`` block so the
  top-level Widgets page knows how to render the weather card separately
  from the Installed skills catalogue.
- An ``entry: plugin.py`` that registers one HTTP route
  (``GET /api/extensions/weather/forecast?city=…``), one agent-callable
  tool (``ext_9_r_weather_fetch``), and one UI-tab declaration. Every
  registration goes through the frozen
  :class:`NEILA.contracts.plugin_api.PluginAPI` v1 surface — the
  extension never touches ``logging``, ``starlette``, or the dispatcher
  directly.
- Four minimum permissions, one per registered surface:
  - ``net`` — the route + tool fetch ``wttr.in``.
  - ``tool`` — required by ``register_tool``.
  - ``route`` — required by ``register_route``.
  - ``widget`` — required by ``register_ui_tab``.

## Using the widget

1. **Enable**: open Skills → Installed, find ``weather``,
   click ``Enable`` (the extension auto-loads after a fresh review).
2. **View**: open the top-level Widgets page. Type a city name and the
   widget refreshes live — no agent message, no shell command.
3. **Agent use**: the same skill is callable from the agent surface as
   ``ext_9_r_weather_fetch(city="...")``. The output is identical JSON.

## Network policy

The widget contacts a single host (``wttr.in``) — the route handler
explicitly refuses any URL whose hostname is not on the allowlist, and
the operator's ``permissions: [net]`` declaration scopes that to the
review-time threat model.

## Data plane

No persistent state is written; the widget fetches on-demand and the
result is rendered directly. The extension's
:meth:`PluginAPI.get_state_dir` is unused.
