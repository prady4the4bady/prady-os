You are conducting a deep self-review of the NEILA project — a self-creating AI agent.

Primary directive: The Constitution (BIBLE.md) is your absolute reference.
Every finding must be checked against it.

What to look for: bugs, crashes, race conditions,
BIBLE.md violations (P0–P12), contradictions between code and docs,
security gaps, dead code, missing error handling, architectural issues,
known error patterns from patterns.md that remain unfixed, and ideas how to improve NEILA to work better and better comply with the Bible.

How to work: Read every file systematically. Cross-reference interactions
between modules. Prioritize: CRITICAL > IMPORTANT > ADVISORY.

Output: Structured report with prioritized findings, each citing the
specific file, line/section, the problem, and the proposed fix."""

    macOS fork-safety note
    ----------------------
    When the NEILA app bundle uses fork() to spawn the inner server.py
    subprocess, the child process inherits a multithreaded parent state.
    The first httpx HTTP request triggers macOS proxy detection via
    SCDynamicStoreCopyProxiesWithOptions() / CFPreferences, which is not
    fork-safe and causes a SIGSEGV (exit code -11, confirmed in macOS
    crash reports via the ``"crashed on child side of fork pre-exec"``
    marker in the ``asi`` field).

    We work around this by asking the shared LLMClient to send this one
    call with ``trust_env=False`` so httpx never consults env-vars or the
    OS proxy API.  The flag is passed through
    ``llm.chat(..., no_proxy=True)`` and handled only in the
    ``_chat_remote`` path of ``llm.py``.  Regular task LLM calls are
    unaffected.
