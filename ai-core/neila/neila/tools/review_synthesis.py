"""review_synthesis.py — LLM-based synthesis of raw reviewer findings into canonical issues.

Phase 1 of the "claim-first, canonical-issue-second" review pipeline redesign.

Design contract:
  * Reviewers produce *claims* (raw evidence-backed findings). They are hypotheses,
    not truth-by-default.
  * This module provides one function: ``synthesize_to_canonical_issues``.
    It merges overlapping claims from multiple reviewers (triad + scope) into
    a deduplicated canonical list before they become durable obligations in state.
  * The synthesizer uses a single cheap LLM call (NEILA_MODEL_LIGHT, low effort).
  * On any failure (import error, parse error, timeout, API error) it falls back
    to returning the raw findings unchanged — the system is no worse than before.
  * Existing ``_update_obligations_from_attempt`` and ``_resolve_matching_obligations``
    logic is untouched; this runs BEFORE obligations are created, so de-duplication
    happens by construction rather than post-hoc.
