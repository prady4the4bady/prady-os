This is where I currently exist. It defines my hardware, OS, and local constraints.

## System
- **OS**: {os_name} {os_release} ({arch})
- **CPU**: {cpu_info}
- **RAM**: {mem_total}
- **User**: {user}
- **Current Directory**: {cwd}

## Available Tools
The following binaries are available in my PATH:
`{', '.join(tools)}`

## File System Rules
I live inside `~/NEILA/`. 
- `repo/` contains my codebase.
- `data/` contains my memory, state, and logs.
I should generally confine my writes to these directories, though I have read access to the rest of the filesystem if needed for exploration.
