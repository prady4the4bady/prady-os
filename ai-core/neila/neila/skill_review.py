"""Tri-model skill review (Phase 3).

Reuses the same review infrastructure that vets repo commits
(``_handle_multi_model_review`` in ``neila.tools.review``) but:

- runs against one external skill package, not the staged diff of the
  self-modifying NEILA repo;
- uses the dedicated ``## Skill Review Checklist`` section in
  ``docs/CHECKLISTS.md`` instead of the Repo Commit Checklist;
- persists the verdict to the *skill* state plane
  (``data/state/skills/<name>/review.json``), not ``advisory_review.json``;
- never touches ``open_obligations`` or ``commit_readiness_debts`` — the
  two surfaces are deliberately siloed so a sticky skill finding cannot
  block repo commits and vice versa.

The module is pure logic: it does not register a tool. The public entry
point is ``review_skill``; the ``skill_review`` CLI tool (in
``NEILA/tools/skill_exec.py``) wraps it.

Use Section 10 (Key Invariants) and Section 12 (External Skills Layer)

particular invariant 11 is the authoritative rule: skills must not write
to the self-modifying repo, and reviewed execution is the primary gate.

## Governance context — docs/DEVELOPMENT.md

Use this as the engineering-standards baseline when judging
``timeout_and_output_discipline`` and when checking whether the skill's
code conforms to the module/function size expectations and the
no-silent-truncation rule for cognitive artifacts.

{development_text}

## Governance context — BIBLE.md

BIBLE.md is NEILA' constitutional core. Skills execute inside the
NEILA runtime, so a skill that violates a constitutional principle
(for example P0 bounded agency, or P9 version-history limits if the
skill manipulates release metadata) is grounds for FAIL even when the
Skill Review Checklist items permit the behaviour in isolation. Treat
BIBLE.md as the tie-breaker when a skill looks checklist-compliant but
contradicts the runtime's constitutional commitments.

Each entry MUST have this shape:

{{"item": "<one of the items above>",
  "verdict": "PASS" | "FAIL",
  "severity": "critical" | "advisory",
  "reason": "<why, citing concrete files/lines inside the skill pack>"}}

Rules:

- Every item must appear exactly once.
- No prose before or after the JSON array.
- If the skill's ``type`` is not ``extension``, mark
  ``extension_namespace_discipline`` as PASS with reason
  "Not applicable — type != extension".
- Base every critical FAIL on a concrete file/line you can quote from
  the skill pack. Do not invent violations.
