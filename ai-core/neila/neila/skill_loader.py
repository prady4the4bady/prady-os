"""External skill discovery, state, and review-status tracking (Phase 3).

Reads skills from the local checkout path configured in settings via
``NEILA_SKILLS_REPO_PATH`` (see ``neila.config.get_skills_repo_path``).
A skill is a directory containing either ``SKILL.md`` (with YAML frontmatter)
or ``skill.json``. The manifest schema lives in
``neila.contracts.skill_manifest``; this module is the runtime-side
loader + state tracker on top of that frozen contract.

Per-skill state — the enabled bit, the most recent review verdict, and a
content hash used to invalidate stale reviews — is stored durably in
``~/NEILA/data/state/skills/<name>/`` so it survives restarts and lives
on the same plane as other durable state (``state.json``,
``advisory_review.json``). The layout:

- ``enabled.json`` — ``{"enabled": bool, "updated_at": iso_ts}``.
- ``review.json``  — ``{"content_hash": str, "status": "pass"|"fail"|"advisory"|"pending"|"pending_phase4",
  "findings": [...], "reviewer_models": [...], "timestamp": iso_ts,
  "prompt_chars": int, "cost_usd": float, "raw_result": str}``.
  ``pending_phase4`` is reserved for ``type: extension`` skills (execution
  deferred until Phase 4); the loader overlays this status on all
  extension skills regardless of persisted verdict so the Phase 3
  catalogue cannot mislead operators into thinking an extension is
  runnable. ``raw_result`` carries the truncated top-level review
  response for replay/debugging (capped via ``_truncate_raw_result`` in
  ``neila.skill_review`` with an explicit OMISSION NOTE on overflow).

Neither file is required on disk — missing files mean "defaults". The module
treats absent state as: ``enabled=False``, ``review.status="pending"``.

Phase 3 scope: ``type: instruction`` and ``type: script`` are surfaced and
reviewable; ``type: extension`` is parsed but skipped with an explicit
``pending_phase4`` status so the skill shows up in the catalogue without
becoming executable.
