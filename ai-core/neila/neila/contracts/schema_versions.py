"""Opt-in schema-version helpers for durable state files.

Phase 1 only introduces *groundwork* for schema versioning — it does **not**
touch existing readers/writers. The concrete migration engine lives later;
this module gives us:

- a canonical key name (``_schema_version``) to embed in JSON files;
- a tiny ``with_schema_version(payload, version)`` helper callers can use
  when they intentionally opt in;
- a tolerant ``read_schema_version`` that treats missing values as ``0``
  (legacy / pre-versioned) so the existing format keeps working.

Current state of each relevant durable file (factual as of this change):

=========================   =========================   ==================
File                        Versioning present?         Current version
=========================   =========================   ==================
``advisory_review.json``    yes, explicit ``state_version`` in
                            ``NEILA/review_state.py``                3
``state.json``              no — ``ensure_state_defaults`` only          0 (legacy)
``queue_snapshot.json``     no                                            0 (legacy)
``task_results/*.json``     no                                            0 (legacy)
``settings.json``           no — ``SETTINGS_DEFAULTS`` is the shape SSOT   0 (legacy)
=========================   =========================   ==================

The helpers in this module do not attempt to retro-fit versions into
existing files on disk. They only make it trivial for future code to start
writing versioned payloads without defining its own key name.

The key ``_schema_version`` (with leading underscore) is chosen to avoid
collisions with the existing ``state_version`` inside ``advisory_review.json``
(which is the authority for that file) and to mark the field as
runtime-metadata rather than domain data.
