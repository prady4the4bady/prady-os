"""Minimal ``ToolContextProtocol`` — the frozen ABI between tools and the runtime.

Rationale
---------
The concrete dataclass ``neila.tools.registry.ToolContext`` is a convenient
carrier with ~20 fields (browser state, event queue, review history, LLM
overrides, …). Individual tool handlers only depend on a much smaller subset.

``ToolContextProtocol`` declares that minimum surface explicitly (6 attributes
plus 3 path helpers) so that:

- external skills/extensions can type-annotate against a small, stable ABI
  instead of the evolving ``ToolContext`` dataclass;
- contract tests can pin the duck-typed invariant that the dataclass still
  satisfies the protocol (``test_contracts.py``);
- future refactors of ``ToolContext`` cannot silently drop one of these
  fields without breaking the test suite.

It is a ``runtime_checkable`` Protocol, so ``isinstance(ctx, ToolContextProtocol)``
works at runtime, but **adds no new behaviour**. Existing tools are not
required to import from this module.

    extensions will pin against it.
