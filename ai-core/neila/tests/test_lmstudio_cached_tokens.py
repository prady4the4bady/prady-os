"""Regression guard for the LM Studio MLX ``cached_tokens=0`` documentation.

LM Studio MLX does NOT emit ``cached_tokens`` via its API — verified
on 2026-05-02 across all three endpoints. This is a documentation-only
test: it pins the explanatory comment in ``NEILA/llm.py`` so any
later refactor that drops it has to make a deliberate decision.

If the comment ever genuinely becomes outdated (e.g. LM Studio adds
the field), update the comment AND this test together.
