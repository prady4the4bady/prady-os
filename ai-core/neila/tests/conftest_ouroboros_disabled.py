    the bundled reference skills leak into the view would make every
    test assertion brittle to changes in the shipped reference set.

    machine with installed skills under ``~/NEILA/data/skills/`` does
    not poison test results. ``discover_skills`` consults
    ``_resolve_data_skills_dir`` for its primary scan; pinning that to
    ``None`` forces tests to either pass an explicit ``drive_root`` (the
    new contract since v4.50 — the helper now honours that argument)
