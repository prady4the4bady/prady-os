"""Tests for the periodic self-check mechanism (`_maybe_inject_self_check`).

v4.34.0 redesign: the checkpoint is no longer a structured-reflection ceremony.
It is a plain `user` message inserted every 15 rounds carrying round/cost
summary, the last-N tool-call trace, and a short directed self-check prompt.
Tools remain enabled, reasoning effort is unchanged, and the message flows
through normal compaction — so the previous `_handle_checkpoint_response`,
`_is_valid_checkpoint_reflection`, `_record_checkpoint_artifact`, and
`_emit_checkpoint_{reflection,anomaly}_event` helpers are no longer needed
and were removed together with the `CHECKPOINT_*` constants and both
`task_checkpoint_reflection` / `task_checkpoint_anomaly` event types.

See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Loop checkpoint section) for the rationale
(0 valid reflections and 37 anomalies in production logs before rewrite).
