"""Tests for v4.33.0 intent split in review_helpers.

Before v4.33.0 `resolve_intent` fell back to the full multi-line commit
message as the "intended transformation" reviewers should fact-check
against the code. Long commit bodies turned every explanatory sentence into
a verifiable claim — and reviewers (correctly) flagged prose-vs-code
divergence as `cross_surface_consistency` critical findings, creating a
loop where each retry added more prose and thus more claim surface.

v4.33.0 separates the two:
  - `resolve_intent` returns only the SUBJECT line (first line, capped at
    _COMMIT_SUBJECT_MAX_CHARS) as the auditable intent.
  - `build_goal_section` surfaces the full commit body separately under a
    `## Informational context` header with explicit "narrative, NOT a
    contract" framing so reviewers don't audit wording against code.
